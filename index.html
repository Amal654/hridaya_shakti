            <h1>Hridaya Shakti</h1>
            <p>Each one of us is on our own and unique journey in life. And in its course, we come across road blocks
                where we find ourselves wondering how to go ahead. Therapy comes in here to help us address these
                difficulties and work towards a meaningful solution. Entering into counseling or in to a
                psychotherapeutic relationship primarily involves gaining a deeper understanding and acceptance of
                oneself. This process can take place for an individual, couple, family or group.

                Hridhaya Shakthi, a center for Counseling and Psychotherapy is committed to a holistic and integrative
                approach to counseling and psychotherapy which affirms the active ongoing interrelationship between
                clinical experience and the spiritual reality of wholeness mediated through the energy of the heart to
                regulate mind, body and spirit. We are committed to the service of men, women and children who value the
                integration of their healthy spirituality with a healthy psychology set in the rich Indian religious and
                cultural tradition.</p>
