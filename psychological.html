            <h2>Psychological assessment</h2>
            <p>When does one need it?
                <br /><br />
                This assessment is used to help individuals, parents, therapists, schools or employers to
                clarify the nature of emotional or cognitive problems and determine the best strategies for addressing
                these difficulties. An assessment can provide answers to questions such as:<br />
                1. What are the emotional issues underlying your depression, anxiety, anger, or other symptoms?<br />
                2. Why is your academic or school performance impaired, and what interventions would improve
                performance?<br />
                3. Are you suffering from an addiction of any kind?<br />
                4. What are the strengths that you may draw upon to make positive changes?<br />
                5. Psychological assessments are used in succession planning, employee screening, pre-employment
                decisions, employee counseling situations as well as to rule out psychopathology in couples intending to
                get married.<br /><br />

                Psychological Tests
                <br /><br />
                Psychological assessment consists of a clinical interview followed by tests that may examine cognitive
                abilities (such as problem-solving or communication skills), emotional status (such as thoughts,
                feelings, and behaviors used to manage emotion) or overall personality functioning with standardized
                tests. The assessment process usually takes 4 to 7 hours of client interview, test administration with
                objective assessment [Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2), Millon Clinical Multiaxial
                Inventory (MCMI-III), Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), Karson Clinical Report - 16PF, Millon
                Index of Personality Styles (MIPS revised), NEO Five-factor inventory, Personal Orientation Inventory
                (POI), California Psychological Inventory (CPI), Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), Edwards Personal
                Preference Schedule (EPPS), Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI), Post traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale
                (PDS), and others], projective assessment [Rorschach Ink Blot Test, Thematic Apperception Test (TAT),
                Children’s Apperception Test-Human Figures (CAT-H) & Supplement (S), Draw-a-Person (DAP),
                House-Tree-Person (H-T-P) Projective Technique, Human Figure Drawing Test (HFDT)] and neuropsychological
                tests. With various testing techniques, the psychologist provides an objective
                outline of the client's strengths and weaknesses across a variety of areas, such as intellectual
                functioning, emotional adjustment, and daily coping.
                <br /><br />
                After the interview, the psychologist writes a report that includes an historical overview of the
                problem, test results and interpretations, diagnoses, treatment recommendations tailored to the
                specifics of the client’s condition and situation, and schedules a feedback session with the client
                and/or the client’s parents or guardians.
