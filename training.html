            <h3> Bowen’s Family systems approach</h3>
            <p>
                Murray Bowen is one of the foremost original thinkers in the field of family therapy. His theory
                represents the intellectual scaffolding upon which much of the mainstream family therapy has been
                erected. Bowen, the developer of the family systems theory, conceptualized the family as an emotional
                unit, a network of interlocking relationships, best understood when analyzed within multigenerational in
                historical framework. His theory emphasizes authentic self-development, healing intergenerational
                issues, and significance of the past, and the systems approaches that restrict one’s attention to the
                family unit as it is presently constituted and currently interacting. Bowen believed the driving force
                underlying all human behavior came from the submerged ebb and flow of family life, the simultaneous push
                and pull between family members for both distance and togetherness. He remained its major theoretician
                until his death in 1990.</p>
