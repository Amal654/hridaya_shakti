            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>Hridaya Shakthi means the energetic heart which animates our mind, body and self and not merely a pumping
                station of blood. From time immemorial people believed that heart had energy, a powerful energy and it
                conveyed deep wisdom. As human beings developed their brain, they began to lose sight of their heart
                process and emphasized the brain process. Hence, some people have either become too cerebral and others
                have become too emotional in responding to life’s exigencies that disrupt an authentic relationship with
                self, others and the world at large. Heart is an integrator or synthesizer of human experiences. Hridaya
                Shakthi envisages through psychotherapy and counseling, the heart should serve as the mediator of a new
                life, or life energy that heals the anxious brain, unhealthy body, fragmented self to relate with
                oneself, others and the world at large in healthy harmony. Through psychotherapy and counseling
                unhealthy and disruptive energy from the past is transformed into life energy that heals the whole
                person – body, mind and spirit – to celebrate life, to celebrate love, and yes, celebrate the mind that
                can come to know its heart.
